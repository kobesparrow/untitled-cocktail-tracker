# Untitled Cocktail Project

On the surface: A simple application intended to track progress through mixing all 77 IBA-approved cocktails. Behind the scenes: an opportunity to refresh my React skills and try new things.

## Description

Users will be able to browse recipes, see which cocktails they've poured and ratings they've given cocktails — all while earning badges along the way. I'm such a sucker for seemingly meaningless achievement badges. Future iterations may allow tracking of a user's liquor cabinet, suggested alterations to cocktails, and custom animations. 

## To Try

Type 'npm start' into your console to run the app in development mode, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
